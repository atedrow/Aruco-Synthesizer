This is my final project of an Aruco Marker Synthizer

Program requirements:
  Program requires OpenCV2, numpy, wave, simpleaudio, struct.pack, and scipy.signal

Notes:
  there may be issues on other machines when opening the webcam
  the Capture may need to be changed from "/dev/video0" to 0 depending
  on the computer

  Make sure to update the calibration video for each webcam too
  Calibration video can be titled "calibrate.mp4" so no code needs to be changed
